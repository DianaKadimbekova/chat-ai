# LimeGPT | LLM Aggregator Platform
**LimeGPT** - A full-stack application that functions as a unified chat interface
 for interacting with leading LLMs (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic). The
 project features an intuitive React frontend, optimized for
 conducting dialogues and comparing AI responses. The Node.js
 backend asynchronously manages requests to external APIs,
 ensuring fast and seamless communication. My responsibilities
 included developing all front-end functionality

 ## Technologies Used
 + **React** - used React to build the user interface of our application. Its component-based architecture allowed us to create reusable and interactive UI elements efficiently.
 + **TypeScript** - We used TypeScript to add static typing to our JavaScript code. This helped us catch errors early during development and made our codebase more robust and maintainable.
 + **i18next (i18n)** - used i18next to implement internationalization (i18n) in our application. This enabled us to easily support multiple languages and provide a localized user experience.
 + **SCSS Modules** - used SCSS Modules to write modular and maintainable styles for our components. SCSS features like variables and nesting, combined with CSS Modulesâ€™ local scoping, helped us avoid style conflicts and keep our stylesheets organized.
 + **Node.js** -  used Node.js as the runtime environment for our development and build processes. It enabled us to manage project dependencies, run scripts, and utilize various tools essential for building and deploying our application.
